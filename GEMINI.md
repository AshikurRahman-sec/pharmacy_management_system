# Gemini AI Instructions - Pharmacy Management System

Follow the instructions in `UNIVERSAL_INSTRUCTIONS.md` as your primary guide. This file contains model-specific adaptations for Gemini.

## Gemini-Specific Guidelines

### Code Generation Style
- Focus on producing clean, efficient code with minimal explanations
- Use the existing codebase patterns without deviation
- Prioritize practical implementation over theoretical discussions

### Problem-Solving Approach
- Analyze the complete system impact before making changes
- Consider pharmacy-specific requirements (expiry dates, batch tracking, etc.)
- Ensure all changes maintain data integrity and regulatory compliance

### Implementation Preferences
- Use the most direct approach to solve problems
- Leverage existing libraries and frameworks already in use
- Maintain consistency with the established code style
- **Mobile First Design**: Ensure all UI components work seamlessly on mobile browsers. Use Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities. Test navigation bars (sidebars) for correct toggling and overlay behavior on small screens (max-width: 768px).

### Quality Assurance
- Double-check all database operations for proper error handling
- Ensure frontend changes maintain responsive design
- Verify authentication and authorization are properly implemented
